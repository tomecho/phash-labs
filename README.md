# Getting started
1. You'll need to install this patched version of phash, go into the phash subfolder and run `./configure; make; sudo make install`
  - it should yell at you a lot about missing depdencies like ffmpeg or it's necessary extensions, just go download those and install them and try the command again
2. Install the phash ruby gem with `gem install pHash`
3. Run the phash-test.rb file in this repo
